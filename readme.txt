== Installation ==

You can use the built in installer and upgrader, or you can install the plugin manually.

1. You can either use the automatic plugin installer or your FTP program to upload it to your wp-content/plugins directory
the top-level folder. Don't just upload all the php files and put them in `/wp-content/plugins/`.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Open your footer.php file and add this code just before the `</body>` tag:
		`<?php
		if (function_exists("activate_maintenance_mode")) {
			activate_maintenance_mode();}
		?>`
1. Go to Maintenance page and update the message you want to display when in maintenance mode
1. To disable maintenance mode, just set the "Message" field to 0 (zero)
1. That's it!

Additionally you can always go and edit the css file located in `plugins/maintenance-mode-notify/css/`.
